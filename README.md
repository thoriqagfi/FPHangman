- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
> If you want to run this program on Visual Studio Code, open the `.vscode/launch.json` file and configure the javafx modules `vmArgs: [your javafx lib path]`
